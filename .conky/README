                CONKY CONFIG BY ROBERT PARTRIDGE ver 0.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This ISN'T a document to explain how to install Conky to a computer.
There are tons of how-to's on the internet on how to do it - Google is
your friend!  To use this Conky config after you have Conky installed,
you need to do the following.

1 - Extract the 2 folders (.fonts and bin) and the .conkyrc file
    included here to your home folder.

2 - The ".fonts" folder contains two fonts that you will need for the
    symbols used in the config.  The font used for text on this config
    is the Ubuntu font.  If you do not have this font, it is freely
    available to download from the web and is easy to find.  If you
    want to use a different font, you'll need to change the font in
    all of the files in the ".conky" folder.

3 - The ".conkyrc" file contains the actual conky configuration.  This
    file is hidden because it begins with a "." so you'll need to be
    able to view hidden files in order to see it in a file manager.

4 - The "bin" directory has three bash scripts.  The script "callconky"
    is used to launch all of the various Conky configs at once.  The
    script "pingtest" is for checking that a computer is online (aka 
    responds to a ping).  The script "getip" returns the IP address for
    a hostname.  Be sure these files have +x permissions.

This config is currently running on a 1280x1024 screen with a 32px
panel on the bottom, so it's positioned to account for this space.

I'd very much be interested to see any modifications anyone makes to
this config for their personal use.  If you make any changes and would
like to share them you can find me on Google+ at the link below:
